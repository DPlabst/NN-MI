## Example 1: Fiber-Channel with Square-Law Photodetector

Considers the oversampled discrete model [1,2] with a memoryless non-linearity

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{Y} = |\mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{X}|^{2} + \mathbf{N}
\end{align}
$$

where

- $\mathbf{H}$ is a Toeplitz matrix constructed from the transmit DAC and fiber channel
- $\mathbf{X}$ is a vector with discrete channel inputs and
- $\mathbf{N}$ is (real) white Gaussian noise with unit variance.

Eq. (1) models a short-range fiber-optic communication system with square-law detection, i.e. the optical-to-electrical conversion is performed by a single photodiode. The noise models thermal noise from photodetection.

As an example, the file [example1_nnmi_v1.0.py](example1_nnmi_v1.0.py) computes achievable information rates via SIC for $L_\text{SSMF} = 10\,\mathrm{km}$ standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) operated in the C-band. The receiver performs square-law detection. 

The considered channel matrix $\mathbf{H}$ is a (subsampled) Toeplitz matrix constructed from two-fold oversampling of the combined response of the transmit DAC and the SSMF. The transmit DAC is operated at a symbol rate of $B = 35\,\mathrm{GBd}$ and performs sinc pulseshaping. The SSMF introduces chromatic dispersion which leads to intersymbol interference (ISI). 

The channel inputs $\mathbf{X}$ are u.i.i.d. 4-ASK symbols with constellation $\mathcal{X} = \{\pm 1, \pm 3\}$. We use SIC with $S=4$ stages, where every stage has a recurrent neural network estimate a-posteriori probabilities for mismatched decoding. The whole setup is listed in [[Tab. IV], on arXiv soon](https://arxiv.org). 

The figure below plots the SIC stage rates for stages $s=1,\ldots,4$ (blue) and the average rate across all stages (red).

<!--
Consider the discrete model with a real 1-bit ADC [cite]: 

$$\mathbf{Y} = \sqrt{P_\text{tx}}\cdot \mathrm{sign}{(\mathbf{H} \mathbf{X})} + \mathbf{N}$$

and where

- $P_\text{tx}$ is the average transmit power 
- $\mathbf{H}$ is a sinc Toeplitz precoder matrix
- $\mathbf{X}$ are iid discrete channel inputs and
- $\mathbf{N}$ is (real) white Gaussian noise with unit variance.

It is straightforward to extend the code to other noise distributions, or memoryless nonlinearities.
