## Example 1: Fiber-Channel with Square-Law Photodetector

The implementation supports the oversampled model [1,2] where the memoryless nonlinearity is applied element-wise:

$$\mathbf{Y} = |\mathbf{H} \mathbf{X}|^{2} + \mathbf{N}$$

and

- $\mathbf{H}$ is a Toeplitz matrix constructed from the transmit DAC and fiber channel
- $\mathbf{X}$ are iid discrete channel inputs and
- $\mathbf{N}$ is (real) white Gaussian noise with unit variance.

## Example 2: Single-Carrier Communication System with Nonlinear Transmit Power Amplifier

## Example 3: Linear Communication System with Intersymbol Interference

<!--
Consider the discrete model with a real 1-bit ADC [cite]: 

$$\mathbf{Y} = \sqrt{P_\text{tx}}\cdot \mathrm{sign}{(\mathbf{H} \mathbf{X})} + \mathbf{N}$$

and where

- $P_\text{tx}$ is the average transmit power 
- $\mathbf{H}$ is a sinc Toeplitz precoder matrix
- $\mathbf{X}$ are iid discrete channel inputs and
- $\mathbf{N}$ is (real) white Gaussian noise with unit variance.

It is straightforward to extend the code to other noise distributions, or memoryless nonlinearities.

## Usage
The file `nnmi_v1.0.py` computes SIC rates for $L_\text{SSMF} = 10\,\mathrm{km}$ standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) operated in the C-band with a square-law detector at the receiver. This setup is described under **Example 1** and accompanying document *[arXiv soon]*. 

The channel matrix $\mathbf{H}$ is a (subsampled) Toeplitz matrix constructed from two-fold oversampling the combined response of the transmit DAC and the SSMF. The transmit DAC is operated at a symbol rate of $B = 35\,GBd$ and performs sinc pulseshaping. The SSMF introduces chromatic dispersion which leads to intersymbol interference. 

The channel inputs $\mathbf{X}$ are u.i.i.d. 4-ASK symbols with constellation $\mathcal{X} = \{\pm 1, \pm 3\}$. We use a SIC-RNN receiver with $S=4$ stages with the settings in [Tab. IV] in the file *[arXiv soon]*.

Running

    python3 nnmi_v1.0.py -m 4-ASK -S 4

computes SIC rates for the **Example 1** under mismatched decoding. The stage rates for stages $s=1,\ldots,4$ (blue) and the average rate across all stages $I_{q,\text{SIC}}(\mathbf{X};\mathbf{Y})$ (red) are displayed in the plot below.
